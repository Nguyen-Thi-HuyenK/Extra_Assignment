# Todo List Application
## Todo app with MVVM and display data retrieved from an open API service following the tutorial by the course teacher with added of my own features as extra assignment for the course.
## Features of the app
- The app fetches data from an open API and displayed the data in the main screen.
- The app contains different folders and files applying the MVVM architecture: model folder
contains file to fetch the data. View-model folder contains file for holding state and
functionality for UI.
- All the screens are placed under ui folder.
- I change the color so that the app uses other color than the default one.
- All strings are saved under resource file.
- There are 2 main screens: Main screen and info screen with navigation implemented to
move between the screens
- The app also displays a trash bin icon for each to-do, but no functionality yet.

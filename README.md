# Todo List Application
## Todo app with MVVM and display data retrieved from an open API service following the tutorial by the course teacher with added of my features as an extra assignment for the course.
## Features of the app
- The app fetches data from an open API and displays the data on the main screen.
- The app contains different folders and files applying the MVVM architecture: the model folder
contains file to fetch the data. The view-model folder contains file for holding state and
functionality for UI.
- All the screens are placed under the ui folder.
- I change the color so that the app uses another color than the default one.
- All strings are saved under the resource file.
- There are 2 main screens: The main screen and the info screen with navigation implemented to
move between the screens
- The app also displays a trash bin icon for each to-do, but no functionality yet.
